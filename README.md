# hello-world
Take a guess ;P

I am a code newbie.  Been working with and around computers for what feels like centuries but a coder/developer I am not.
This is my first(ish) foray into git.  Hopefully, it will be as easy as I thought it would be (glwT right?)

So. 
See you on the other side I guess.

Peace.
